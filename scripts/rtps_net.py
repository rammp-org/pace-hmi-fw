"""Network discovery and remembered settings for the RTPS test tools.

Three jobs, all stdlib:

  * name this PC's network adapters, so "which of these six addresses is the
    real LAN" is answerable by looking rather than guessing;
  * find the board, and from it work out which adapter actually reaches it;
  * remember what worked, so the next run needs no flags.

The adapter question is the one that has cost the most time on this project. A
multi-homed machine (Tailscale, VirtualBox, VMware, a VPN) has no single
"local IP", and the usual trick of routing to 8.8.8.8 answers a question nobody
asked — it names the adapter that reaches the *internet*, which on a bench
network is rarely the one that reaches the board. source_address_for() asks the
kernel the right question instead: which source address would a packet to THIS
destination leave from.
